pySight
=======

pySight is a experimental debugging tool for Python.
It modifies the abstract syntax tree of a parsed script wrapping all variables, function calls, attribute accesses and other expressions enabling you to verify and manipulate objects in your running application.

With the scribes plugin you can select an expression and see the values it returned.
Because print is not a debugger - no need to print variables you want to track and restart your code :-)
 
You can even modify an object in your running programm with the IPython shell. Just select the variable and press a keyboard shortcut. You don't need to import and instantiate objects to test them.


Later I'll make a video demonstrating what you can do with pySight.


Currently pySight is more a proof of concept and should not be used for production.
